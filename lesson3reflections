1) When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

If you've got different people who might be in different locales or in the office at different
times then keeping the files on a server for them all to access the latest versions 
is best.  Also if you want to share your work with others.

2) Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git 
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

If the computer pulled the changes manually, you might have a conflict with the
way you've been working on a file with the way that someone else has changed the file.
Also, you might have issues committing anew if the file your working on is no
longer the tip of the branch.

3) Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would 
you use one instead of another?

Forks are creating a copy of another branch for yourself, clones recreate a branch either
on your github or on your local computer, and branches are for your repositories to
have different features that may not want to affect the master files.  Forks are
for when you don't have access to edit another persons commits but want to change stuff
in them, clones are for accessing in your local computer and branches are for making
changes that you don't want to affect the master files.

4) What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

in case you need to operate offline or to have a state of where other collaborators are
before you begin your local work.

5) How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, 
and what would be harder? 

You wouldn't have to have knowledge about the site or it's form in order to do it
manually but at the same time the benefits of having the site check and track 
things for you is far better.
