1) When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

If you've got different people who might be in different locales or in the office at different
times then keeping the files on a server for them all to access the latest versions 
is best.  Also if you want to share your work with others.

2) Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git 
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

If the computer pulled the changes manually, you might have a conflict with the
way you've been working on a file with the way that someone else has changed the file.
Also, you might have issues committing anew if the file your working on is no
longer the tip of the branch.
