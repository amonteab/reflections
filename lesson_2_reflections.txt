1) What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do 
you need to do it?

Git creates a 'hidden' directory that will contain all the committed
versions of the files that are being tracked.  Without that, there
is no version control.

2) How is the staging area different from the working directory 
and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

The staging area is like purgatory where the files aren't committed yet
but will be and the repository is where they go.  It makes it much more succinct
in that you can only commit the files that need it when they need it.
